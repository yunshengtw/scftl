* stat.size is u32
* get gcc asm labels working for cpu, proc, kmem
  - (I couldn't stop gcc from generating RIP-relative movs)
* get something like asm labels working in clang
  - (is there a way to use address_space(256) attributes?)
* on real hw, apicid != logical ID, but this breaks things.
* finish syscall/sysret implementation
* make uart console work over IPMI SOL
* make syslinux/pxelinux work over IPMI SOL
* the elf loader in exec.c is a bit sketchy
  - e.g. mandates vaddr page-alignment
* $grep "XXX(sbw)" *
